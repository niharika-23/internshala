9	9	It was a waste of my money.	1
10	10	This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.	1

12	12	How stupid is that?	0
13	13	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	1

21	21	The commercials are the most misleading.	1
22	22	I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	1

41	41	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.	1
42	42	It has kept up very well.	1

44	44	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	1
45	45	When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.	1

66	66	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.	1

68	68	Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.	1
69	69	After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.	0
70	70	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	1

73	73	Good price.	1

97	97	I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.	1

123	123	Excellent starter wireless headset.	1
124	124	I am very happy	1
125	125	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	1
126	126	All three broke within two months of use.	1
127	127	Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.	1
128	128	All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.	0
129	129	Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!	1
130	130	It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.	1
131	131	Excellent Phone.	1
132	132	Poor Construction.	1
133	133	Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	1
134	134	A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.	0
135	135	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.	1
136	136	People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.	1
137	137	Great Phone.	1
138	138	The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.	1
139	139	Would recommend this item.	1
140	140	I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.	1
141	141	Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.	1
142	142	It worked very well.	1
143	143	I wasted my little money with this earpiece.	1
144	144	Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.	1
145	145	Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	1
146	146	This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.	1
147	147	The replacement died in a few weeks.	1
148	148	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.	1
149	149	2 thumbs up to this seller	1
150	150	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.	1
151	151	Incredible!.	1
152	152	Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!	1
153	153	It definitely was not as good as my S11.	1
154	154	Very satisifed with that.	1
155	155	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.	1
156	156	disappointed.	1
157	157	The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.	1
158	158	What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...	1
159	159	Works great!.	1
160	160	The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.	0
161	161	You'll love how thin it is.	1
162	162	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	1
163	163	The case is great and works fine with the 680.	1
164	164	It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1
165	165	Provides good protection and looks classy, too.	1
166	166	It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.	1
167	167	Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.	1
168	168	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	1
169	169	I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.	0
170	170	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	1
171	171	Great price, too!	1

175	175	Keep up the good work Amazon!!	1
176	176	It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.	1
177	177	Sending it back.	1
178	178	This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	0
179	179	every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.	1
180	180	This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1

182	182	Don't make the same mistake I did.	0
183	183	Great product and price.	1
184	184	We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.	1
185	185	Freezes frequently4.	1
186	186	It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	0
187	187	However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.	1
188	188	Great Value.	1
189	189	Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.	1
190	190	Horrible, horrible protector.	0
191	191	Same problem as others have mentioned.	1
192	192	Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	0
193	193	It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.	1
194	194	Not impressed.	1
195	195	however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.	1
196	196	I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.	1
197	197	I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.	0
198	198	Works well.	1
199	199	I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.	1
200	200	If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.	1
201	201	The shipping time was also very quick!	0
202	202	Really pleased with this product so far.	0
203	203	Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.	1
204	204	The iGo chargers and tips are really great.	0
205	205	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.	1
206	206	Great for iPODs too.	1
207	207	The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.	1
208	208	None of it works, just don't buy it.	0
209	209	I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!	1
210	210	awesome device.	1
211	211	Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.	1
212	212	Great product for the price!.	1
213	213	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.	1
214	214	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.	1
215	215	It's not what it says it is.	1
216	216	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	1
217	217	Very Displeased.	1
218	218	I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.	0
219	219	It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	0
220	220	Worst customer service.	1
221	221	Thank you for such great service.	1
222	222	Five star Plus, plus.	1
223	223	After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.	0
224	224	I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.	1
225	225	The buttons for on and off are bad.	0
226	226	The instruction manual is lacking.	1
227	227	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
228	228	It's pretty easy.	1
229	229	So Far So Good!.	1
230	230	Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.	1
231	231	I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!	1
232	232	I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.	1
233	233	This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.	1
234	234	It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.	0
235	235	I wouldn't recommend buying this product.	1
236	236	I was not impressed by this product.	1
237	237	Great audio!.	1
238	238	This is a beautiful phone.	1
239	239	The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.	1
240	240	Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.	0
241	241	This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.	1
242	242	Good audio quality.	1
243	243	Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.	1
244	244	The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.	1
245	245	Very good quality though	1
246	246	However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.	1
247	247	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.	0
248	248	I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.	0
249	249	The pleather case doesn't fit.	1
250	250	AMAZON SUCKS.	0
251	251	I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.	1
252	252	If you are Razr owner...you must have this!	1
253	253	It's a great item.	1
254	254	Sprint charges for this service.	1
255	255	Not a good bargain.	1
256	256	Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.	1
257	257	Talk about USELESS customer service.	1
258	258	This one works and was priced right.	0
259	259	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	1
260	260	It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	0
261	261	i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.	1
262	262	This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.	1
263	263	Low Quality.	1
264	264	This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.	0
265	265	A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!	1
266	266	That company is a joke.	1
267	267	I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	1
268	268	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	1
269	269	Excellent bluetooth headset.	1
270	270	Buy a different phone - but not this.	1
271	271	useless phone, simply deaf.	1
272	272	I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.	1
273	273	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	1
274	274	When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	1
275	275	Great product, fast shipping!.	1
276	276	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.	1
277	277	However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	1
278	278	This battery is an excellent bargain!	1
279	279	I want my money back.	1
280	280	What a waste of money and time!.	0
281	281	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	1
282	282	Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	1
283	283	Audio Quality is poor, very poor.	1
284	284	The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	1
285	285	I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .	1
286	286	The reception through this headset is excellent.	1
287	287	Gets the job done.	1
288	288	No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1
289	289	Excellent hands free tool.	1
290	290	The battery runs down quickly.	1
291	291	Bad Purchase.	0
292	292	I highly recommend this device to everyone!	1
293	293	For the price this was a great deal.	1
294	294	Doesn't Work.	1
295	295	I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.	0
296	296	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1
297	297	It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.	0
298	298	I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
299	299	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.	1
300	300	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	1
301	301	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	1
302	302	Works great.	1
303	303	The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.	1
304	304	A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.	1
305	305	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.	1
306	306	Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.	1
307	307	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1
308	308	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	1
309	309	WORST PHONE EVER.	1
310	310	Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!	1
311	311	Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended	1
312	312	And the sound quality is great.	1
313	313	This item is fantastic and works perfectly!	1
314	314	If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.	0
315	315	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	1
316	316	I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.	1
317	317	Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.	1
318	318	Earbud piece breaks easily.	1
319	319	I am more than happy with this product.	1
320	320	Couldn't figure it out	1
321	321	Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).	1
322	322	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.	0
323	323	Better Than New.	0
324	324	* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!	1
325	325	Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	1

330	330	REALLY UGLY.	0
331	331	I could not recommend these more.	1
332	332	Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	1

334	334	I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	1

348	348	Piece of Junk.	1
349	349	Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	0
350	350	Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !	1
351	351	The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.	1

364	364	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.	1
365	365	don't waste your money.	1
366	366	Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.	1
367	367	We are sending it back.	1
368	368	A Disappointment.	1
369	369	All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.	1
370	370	I'm still infatuated with this phone.	1
371	371	I great reception all the time.	0
372	372	Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.	1
373	373	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.	0
374	374	Does everything it should and more.	0
375	375	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1

383	383	Battery is terrible.	0
384	384	I'm very disappointed with my decision.	1
385	385	Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.	1
386	386	These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.	1
387	387	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	1
388	388	Someone shouldve invented this sooner.	1
389	389	This is a great phone!.	1
390	390	I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	1
391	391	I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.	1
392	392	good protection and does not make phone too bulky.	1
393	393	First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.	0
394	394	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1
395	395	They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.	1

404	404	Good transmit audio.	1
405	405	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	1
406	406	No real improvement.	1
407	407	Poor quality.	1
408	408	Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!	1

410	410	Poor Reliability.	1
411	411	NOT WHAT I WANTED.	1
412	412	Disappointed with battery.	1

414	414	Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!	1
415	415	Very disappointing.	1
416	416	Poor product.	1
417	417	Don't buy it.	1
418	418	Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.	1
419	419	Happy so far!.	1
420	420	I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.	1
421	421	Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.	1
422	422	Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory	1
423	423	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.	1
424	424	Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.	1
425	425	You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	1
426	426	Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.	1
427	427	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	1
428	428	One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.	0
429	429	Works good.	1
430	430	it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.	0
431	431	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.	1
432	432	Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.	1
433	433	It was horrible!.	0
434	434	IT'S REALLY EASY.	0
435	435	Warning - Stay away.	1
436	436	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.	1
437	437	As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	1
438	438	It is a joy to use.	1
439	439	VERY comfortable.	1
440	440	worthless product.	1
441	441	I would recommend this.	1
442	442	I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.	0
443	443	I bought two of them and neither will charge.	1
444	444	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	1
445	445	poor quality and service.	1
446	446	Just does not work.	0
447	447	Best headset ever!!!.	1
448	448	All in all I think it was a good investment.	1
449	449	Blue Ant is easy to use.	1
450	450	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	0
451	451	They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	0
452	452	I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	0
453	453	Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.	1
454	454	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.	1
455	455	I'm returning them.	1
456	456	Great Earpiece.	1
457	457	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.	1
458	458	New Battery works great in phone.	1
459	459	Fantastic earphones.	1
460	460	Now I know that I made a wise decision.	1
461	461	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	0
462	462	Terrible product, and waste of money!	0
463	463	Better than expected.	0
464	464	Waste of money.	1
465	465	There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.	0
466	466	The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.	1
467	467	Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	1
468	468	This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.	1
469	469	I love this device.	1
470	470	Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.	1
471	471	Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	1
472	472	I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.	0
473	473	At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).	1
474	474	I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.	1
475	475	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	0
476	476	Works great!.	1
477	477	Everything about this product is wrong.First	1
478	478	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.	1
479	479	Battery life is also great!	1
480	480	The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.	1
481	481	Worst ever.	1
482	482	Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0
483	483	I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	1
484	484	Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is	1
485	485	Never got it!!!!!	1
486	486	THAT one didn't work either.	1
487	487	It does everything the description said it would.	0
488	488	Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	1
489	489	EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.	1
490	490	Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..	1
491	491	It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.	1
492	492	Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.	0
493	493	Product is exactly as described.	1
494	494	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
495	495	Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.	1
496	496	But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1
497	497	If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.	1
498	498	Awsome Device Works Great!!.	1
499	499	An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.	1
500	500	I love this thing!	1
501	501	I found this product to be waaay too big.	0
502	502	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	1
503	503	I would have given no star if I was able.	1
504	504	The reception is excellent!	1
505	505	It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.	1
506	506	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	0
507	507	How can that be?The audio quality is poor.	1
508	508	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	0
509	509	It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.	1
510	510	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.	1
511	511	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.	1
512	512	Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.	1
513	513	Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.	0
514	514	After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	1
515	515	Having trouble with volume.	1
516	516	Will order from them again!	1
517	517	Excellent sound quality.	1
518	518	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	0
519	519	!I definitly recommend!!	1
520	520	This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.	1
521	521	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.	1
522	522	These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.	1
523	523	I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	0
524	524	The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.	1
525	525	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.	1
526	526	Customer service was terrible.	0
527	527	This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.	1
528	528	Nice headset priced right.	0
529	529	A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.	1
530	530	They do not care about the consumer one bit.	1
531	531	Great phone.	1
532	532	Good case!.	1
533	533	Very good stuff for the price.	1
534	534	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	1
535	535	It's AGGRAVATING!	1
536	536	Easy to use.	1
537	537	what a disappointment	1
538	538	good item, low price.	1
539	539	DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.	1
540	540	Absolutel junk.	1
541	541	It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.	1
542	542	The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.	0
543	543	A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.	1
544	544	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.	1
545	545	W810i is just SUPERB.	0
546	546	Don't bother - go to the store.	1
547	547	I only hear garbage for audio.	1
548	548	I don't like this Nokia either.	1
549	549	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	1
550	550	This fixes all the problems.	1
551	551	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
552	552	O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.	1
553	553	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.	1
554	554	Painful on the ear.	1
555	555	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.	1
556	556	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!	1
557	557	Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.	1
558	558	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1
559	559	The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.	1
560	560	I love this phone!.	1
561	561	Not as good as I had hoped.	1
562	562	My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.	1
563	563	Good show, Samsung.	1
564	564	The noise shield is incrediable.	1
565	565	I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	0
566	566	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.	1
567	567	I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.	0
568	568	very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.	1
569	569	Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	1
570	570	My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.	1
571	571	It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.	1
572	572	It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	1
573	573	Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	1
574	574	Plug was the wrong size.	1
575	575	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.	1
576	576	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	1
577	577	This device is great in several situations:1.)	1
578	578	Pretty piece of junk.	1
579	579	"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."	1
580	580	Please dont waste your money.	1
581	581	There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.	1
582	582	All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	1
583	583	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	1
584	584	I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1
585	585	If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.	1
586	586	I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.	1
587	587	It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	1
588	588	Waste of 13 bucks.	1
589	589	While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.	1
590	590	This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.	1
591	591	Excellent!.	1
592	592	It has been a winner for us.	1
593	593	My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!	0
594	594	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	1
595	595	Don't waste your $$$ on this one.	1
596	596	He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.	1
597	597	It is simple to use and I like it.	1
598	598	The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	1
599	599	It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	0
600	600	Was not happy.	1
601	601	Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.	1
602	602	Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.	1
603	603	This is infuriating.	1
604	604	Phone falls out easily.	1
605	605	The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.	1
606	606	:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.	0
607	607	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.	1
608	608	Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.	0
609	609	Also makes it easier to hold on to.	1
610	610	So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.	1
611	611	Good product - incredible value.	1
612	612	Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.	1
613	613	But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.	0
614	614	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1
615	615	Defective crap.	1
616	616	But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.	1
617	617	This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	1
618	618	Dont waste your money...	1
619	619	Great case and price!	1
620	620	AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.	1
621	621	I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.	1
622	622	The ear buds only play music in one ear.	1
623	623	I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).	1
624	624	The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.	1
625	625	sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.	0
626	626	It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.	1
627	627	The best phone in market :).	1
628	628	Kind of flops around.	1
629	629	Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.	0
630	630	Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	1
631	631	The BT headset was such a disapoinment.	1
632	632	Battery lasts only a few hours.	1
633	633	Great Pocket PC / phone combination.	1
634	634	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1
635	635	The accompanied software is almost brilliant.	1
636	636	Comfortable in my hand.	1
637	637	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!	0
638	638	This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.	1
639	639	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1
640	640	Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.	1
641	641	Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!	1
642	642	It also had a new problem.	1
643	643	I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.	1
644	644	Comfort for our whole family.	1
645	645	Stay Away From the Q!.	1
646	646	"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7."	1
647	647	Were JERKS on the phone.	1
648	648	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.	0
649	649	I was very impressed with the price of the cases.	1
650	650	And none of the tones is acceptable.	1
651	651	It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	1
652	652	Returned 8 hours later.	1
653	653	Doesn't hold charge.	1
654	654	That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.	0
655	655	Protects the phone on all sides.	1
656	656	In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.	1
657	657	Worth every penny.	1
658	658	I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.	1
659	659	"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"	1
660	660	Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.	1
661	661	I'm pleased.	1
662	662	I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.	1
663	663	Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.	1
664	664	Needless to say, I wasted my money.	1
665	665	This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0
666	666	Battery charge-life is quite long.	1
667	667	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	1
668	668	Disapointing Results.	1
669	669	We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros	1
670	670	The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.	1
671	671	So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.	1
672	672	Definitely a bargain.	1
673	673	Truly awful.	1
674	674	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1
675	675	It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	1
676	676	camera color balance is AWFUL.	1
677	677	I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.	0
678	678	First of all, it doesn't wear well.	1
679	679	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.	0
680	680	It is very comfortable on the ear.	1
681	681	I received it quickly and it works great!!	1
682	682	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1
683	683	Cumbersome design.	1
684	684	I would not recommend this item to anyone.	1
685	685	The item received was Counterfeit.	1
686	686	I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	1
687	687	Restored my phone to like new performance.	1
688	688	Don't buy this product.	1
689	689	They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	0
690	690	dont buy it.	1
691	691	Great price also!	1
692	692	"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."	1
693	693	Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.	1
694	694	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.	1
695	695	Very good phone.	1
696	696	So far it has worked like a charm.	1
697	697	It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	0
698	698	Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.	0
699	699	The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.	1
700	700	Great phone!.	1
701	701	This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.	1
702	702	I am glad I purchased it.	1
703	703	The mic is great.	1
704	704	Buttons are too small.	1
705	705	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	1
706	706	I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.	1
707	707	That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	1
708	708	The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.	1
709	709	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	1
710	710	Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	1
711	711	I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.	0
712	712	Those phones are working just fine now.	0
713	713	Bad Choice.	0
714	714	If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.	0
715	715	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	1
716	716	I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.	1
717	717	Works fine.	1
718	718	Good case, Excellent value.	1
719	719	The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.	0
720	720	I would recommend it.	1
721	721	Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.	1
722	722	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	0
723	723	Excellent product for the price.	1
724	724	Great Phone.	1

751	751	Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.	1
752	752	I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.	0
753	753	This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.	1
754	754	No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.	1
755	755	It has all the features I want	1
756	756	Plan on ordering from them again and again.	1
757	757	This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.	1
758	758	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	1
759	759	As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!	1
760	760	Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	1
761	761	Poor Talk Time Performance.	0
762	762	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.	1
763	763	I would highly recommend this.	1
764	764	It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.	1

771	771	I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.	1
772	772	Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	1
773	773	The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.	1
774	774	Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	1
775	775	Piece of trash.	1

805	805	Voice recognition is tremendous!	1
806	806	I cannot make calls at certain places.	1
807	807	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	1

809	809	Very wind-resistant.	1
